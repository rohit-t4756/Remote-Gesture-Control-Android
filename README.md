# Gesture-Controlled Android System 

This project allows you to remotely control an Android device using hand gestures captured by a webcam. It uses a Python script for computer vision and a Firebase Realtime Database to send commands to an Android accessibility service.

## Key Features

* **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate and fast hand landmark detection.
* **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes distinct gestures like taps and directional swipes.
* **Wireless Control**: Sends commands over the internet via Firebase for real-time control.
* **On-screen Cursor**: Displays a visual cursor on the Android device for feedback.

## Tech Stack

* **Python Script**:
    * OpenCV
    * MediaPipe
    * Firebase Admin SDK
* **Android App**:
    * Java/Kotlin
    * Android Accessibility Service
    * Firebase Realtime Database SDK

## Setup and Installation

### Python Script

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2.  Navigate to the `python_script` directory.
3.  Install the required packages: `pip install opencv-python mediapipe firebase-admin`
4.  **IMPORTANT**: Download your Firebase Admin SDK private key. Rename it to `firebase_key.json` and place it inside the `python_script` folder.

### Android App

1.  Open the `android_app` folder in Android Studio.
2.  Let Gradle sync the project.
3.  Run the app on a physical device.
4.  Enable the Accessibility Service for the app when prompted in your device's settings.

## Usage

1.  Run the Python script on your computer. A webcam feed should appear.
2.  Open the Android app on your phone.
3.  Perform the recognized gestures in front of the webcam to control your device.
